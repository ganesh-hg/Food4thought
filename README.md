An important goal in our world today is to eliminate food waste by reutilizing available food sources within local communities leftover
food items in restaurants, stores and food distribution centers that may be approaching expiration and any perishable items not used
in entirety within their desired period. This is highly significant, particularly during crises suchas the COVID-19 pandemic. This project
focuses on creating aninteresting mobile application (app) called Bhojansamvedi that provides a ubiquitous platform wherein users
can visualize available food resources in their local area and consequently gain access to food, thereby tackling two major issues, i.e.
hunger and food waste.
